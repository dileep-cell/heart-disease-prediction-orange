## Project Overview

This repository provides an Orange workflow for heart disease analysis. The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling using an accessible, drag-and-drop platform.

## Features

- End-to-end workflow in Orange
- Data preprocessing and cleaning nodes
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization widgets
- Multiple machine learning models (classification)
- Visual performance evaluation

## Workflow

1. **Data Import**  
   Load the heart disease dataset into Orange.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical features using Orange's Preprocess widgets.

3. **Modeling**  
   Fit various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) by connecting learner widgets.

4. **Evaluation**  
   Compare models using Test & Score, ROC Analysis, and Confusion Matrix widgets.

## Screenshots

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si/) (version 3.30+ recommended)

### Installation

Download and install Orange from the [official website](https://orange.biolab.si/download/).

## Usage

1. **Open Orange.**
2. **Load the Workflow:**
   - Go to `File > Open` and select the provided `.ows` workflow file from this repository.
3. **Run the Analysis:**
   - Ensure the dataset is loaded correctly.
   - Inspect and modify preprocessing steps as needed.
   - Try different models by connecting/disconnecting learner widgets.
   - View results in evaluation widgets.

> **Tip:** You can visualize and tweak each step interactively within Orange.
